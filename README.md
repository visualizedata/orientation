### Agenda for this weekend

1. The [data](https://github.com/visualizedata/visualizedata.github.io/blob/master/js/data.js)  
2. Inspiration sites:  
  * [http://mfadt.parsons.edu/2018/](http://mfadt.parsons.edu/2018/)  
  * [http://bfacd.parsons.edu/](http://bfacd.parsons.edu/)  
  * [http://creative-publishing.org/](http://creative-publishing.org/)  
  * [http://art.yale.edu/](http://art.yale.edu/) which some people [didn't like](http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/dailysucker/2010/05/25/yale-school-of-art-example-of-dickhead-web-design-for-tuesday-may-25-2010/) and [pilloried](https://webpagesthatsuck.smugmug.com/Web-Design/Videos/i-rc2bjDq/A)  
3. To prepare for tomorrow:  
  * If you have not yet created an account on GitHub, [create one](https://github.com/join). Be [careful in choosing a username](https://github.com/shithead), because your account will be a resource to share with potential employers. **Everyone: email Aaron your GitHub username.**  
  * Create a [free AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) using your New School email address. This requires you to enter a credit card. There is an option to create an account without a credit card, but it dramatically reduces the benefits you will get from AWS Educate.  
  * Sign up for [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/). Enter the institution name as "The New School", which will entitle you to $100 in free credits per year, in addition to the credits you receive when you sign up for a new AWS account.  
  * Start thinking about and/or sketching ideas for [https://parsons.nyc/](https://parsons.nyc/)  
  * Sustenance: we'll have coffee for you in the morning, and a full lunch on Saturday and snack/light lunch on Sunday.

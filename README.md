**Activities**

* If you have not yet created an account on GitHub, [create one](https://github.com/join). Be [careful in choosing a username](https://github.com/shithead), because your account will be a resource to share with collaborators and potential employers. **Everyone: tell Daniel your GitHub username and check that it is listed [here](https://github.com/orgs/visualizedata/people).**
* Create a [free AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) using your New School email address. This requires you to enter a credit card. There is an option to create an account without a credit card, but it dramatically reduces the benefits you will get from AWS Educate.
* Sign up for [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/). Enter the institution name as "The New School", which will entitle you to $100 in free credits per year, in addition to the credits you receive when you sign up for a new AWS account.

#### 4:00pm-4:30pm 
* [AWS Cloud 9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/)

* GitHub
  * [https://github.com/visualizedata/](https://github.com/visualizedata/)
  * [MSDV GitHub workflow](https://github.com/visualizedata/github-workflow)
